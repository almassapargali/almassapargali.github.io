Hello, I'm an independent software developer from Kazakhstan. I build iOS apps using Swift, and web backends with [Phoenix](http://www.phoenixframework.org). I've worked with various clients across the world. [Here](/projects) you can take a look at some of my projects. I care about high-quality code and delivering value to my clients. I take pride in every single app I've built, and want them be perfect.

## What my clients says

> Almas is awesome. Great job for me not only working on my spec and delivering a great product but also taking care of me to make sure we made good choices, etc.

> Please to work with - fast and great code quality!

<cite>by [Ian Connor](https://au.linkedin.com/in/iconnor), CTO Enthuse, ilab Accelerator</cite>

> Almas is a gem out there! We really worked well together, and I would hire him anytime if he becomes available again. Thanks again!

> I can definitely recommend Almas. I pursued a project in Objective-C, partly in RoR. Almas did an excellent job. He is very committed, he absolutely keeps timelines, he uses effective approaches to realize tasks, and he also a very good communicator. I could nearly always reach Almas, so my project could be finished in record time. For sure a programmer you should take!
